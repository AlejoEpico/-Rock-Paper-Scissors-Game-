# -Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-
 This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game using Python. The program allows users to play against the computer and keeps track of the points for both the user and computer. The game is played in the console, and the user can choose their move by entering "rock" 🪨, "paper" 📄, or "scissors" ✂️. The computer's move is randomly generated. The repository serves as a beginner-friendly project for practicing Python programming concepts, including conditionals, loops, and random number generation. Have fun playing the game and improving your Python skills! 🎮🐍
